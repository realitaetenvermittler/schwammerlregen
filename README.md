## precipitation maps for mushroom hunting in austria

This project aims to help mushroom hunters identify promising regions in Austria by analyzing recent precipitation data.  
Rainfall is a key factor for mushroom growth â€” many edible species appear a few days after significant rainfall.

## Goals
- Collect and process precipitation data (e.g., from GeoSphere Austria).
- Aggregate rainfall amounts by region.
- Visualize recent precipitation sums on an interactive map.
- Provide an easy way to check where conditions are good for mushroom hunting.

## Features (planned)
- Automated data retrieval for the past ~week.
- Mobile-friendly interactive map.

## Status
Currently working on a first prototype.
