## precipitation maps for mushroom hunting in austria

This project aims to help mushroom hunters identify promising regions in Austria by analyzing recent precipitation data.  
Rainfall is a key factor for mushroom growth — many edible species appear a few days after significant rainfall.

## Goals
- Collect and process precipitation data (e.g., from GeoSphere Austria).
- Aggregate rainfall amounts by region (districts, municipalities).
- Visualize recent precipitation sums on an interactive map.
- Provide an easy way to check where conditions are good for mushroom hunting.

## Features (planned)
- Automated data retrieval for the past 3–7 days.
- Threshold highlighting (e.g., regions with >20 mm rainfall).
- Mobile-friendly interactive map (Leaflet-based).
- Option to host the map via GitHub Pages.

## Status
Early prototype — data processing and map rendering in progress.
